# Summary
This is a tool I wrote for turning vocabulary words into backgrounds for computer desktops. If I remember right it doesn't quite work, and needs a lot of help. 

# Dependencies
This tool depends on 
    - pandas
    - matplotlib

# Building
1. Create a venv:
`python -m venv ./`

2. Install deps:
`pip install pandas matplotlib`
